## Features

- **Brain Tumor Detection**: Utilizes a pretrained model to predict the presence of a tumor in MRI scans.
- **Advanced Metrics**: Provides in-depth analysis, including intensity and texture metrics.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Measures prediction stability under noise and blur effects.
- **Multi-View Analysis**: Displays original, contrast-enhanced, and edge-detected views.
- **3D Visualization**: Surface plot for enhanced visualization of MRI scan intensities.
